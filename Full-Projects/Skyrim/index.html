                    Tamriel, also known as Taazokaan in the Dragon Language, is one of the continents on Nirn - the Mortal Plane, the planet upon which Tamriel and the mortal races reside. Tamriel is a great melting pot of cultures and races. It is home to at least a dozen races, with dozens more having died out or changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are nine distinct provinces, each home to one of the more populous races of Tamriel. A proposed tenth province, Orsinium, has never been taken very seriously except by those who want it, namely the Orcs, who wish to have a home province of their own.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel, is a cold and mountainous region also known as the Old Kingdom, Mereth, or the Fatherland, or Keizaal in the dragon tongue. Many past battles have given it a ravaged appearance and many ruins. Though currently inhabited primarily by Nords, the Elves who they replaced had resided there since time immemorial. The sovereign, the High King of Skyrim, is chosen by the Moot, a convention of jarls. A jarl is a regional ruler chosen through heredity and, rarely, through right of arms. The High King typically rules until death, though acts of dishonor, particularly the appearance of cowardice, can lead to the recall and reconsideration of the Moot. Since the Pact of Chieftains was signed in 1E 420, the Moot does not give serious consideration to anyone but the High King's direct heir unless one is not available.

                    Skyrim has nine holds, or regions, each governed by a jarl - Eastmarch, Falkreath Hold, Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, The Pale, The Reach, The Rift, Whiterun Hold, Winterhold. Many of the holds have distinct climates, such as the Rift being an aspen forest, Falkreath Hold being a pine forest, and Eastmarch being tundra. Snowy mountain environments are also found in part of most holds.

                    Whiterun Hold is a hold in Skyrim, located roughly in the middle of the province. Roads are numerous and well maintained, and visibility across the plains is excellent. The hold is relatively flat, surrounded the by mountains of the Reach to the west of the Tundra Plateau, the Skyborn Range of Hjaalmarch and the Yorgrim Forest of the Pale to the north, and the Brittleshin Hills of Falkreath to the south. However, Whiterun's southeastern corner is dominated by the gigantic and soaring Throat of the Worldâ€”the highest mountain in all of Tamriel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whiterun is certainly one of the most well-tracked holds, with main roads and excellent access west to the Reach, with a border road north through the town of Rorikstead and up toward Dragon Bridge. The plains have a number of odd barrows and giant camps to investigate, and the center is dominated by Fort Greymoor and the surrounding Greymoor Foothills. The road here allows travel to the north, up through the Skyborn mountains to reach the dreaded Labyrinthian in Hjaalmarch. Further east is Whiterun and the roaring White River and town of Riverwood on the southern border with Falkreath. Another road stretches north from here, into the wilds of the Pale. There's yet another road that skirts the northern foothills of the Throat of the World, following White River Valley into Eastmarch. Although the first of the 7,000 steps that pilgrims climb to reach the summit of Throat of the World begins in Ivarstead (in the Rift), the actual mountain lies within Whiterun's domain.

                <p>
                    Giants are often seen traversing the landscape while herding mammoths to grazing areas or back to their camps. Surrounding the eponymous capital, Whiterun, are fertile plains dotted with farms that supply the food for much of Skyrim. The other notable settlements in the hold are Rorikstead and Riverwood.

                    Whiterun is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, serving as the capital of Whiterun Hold and its vast open tundra. It is found in the heart of Skyrim, and because of this, it is the center of trade across the province. It has been described as the <q>Imperial City of Skyrim</q>, and its large palace has been compared to Cyrodilic castles. It has a rich and important history that dates back to the Five Hundred Companions and is the site the mythical forge known as the Skyforge. In the Dragon Language, the city is known as <dfn>Ahrolsedovah</dfn>, which means <dfn>Hill-of-Dragon</dfn>.
                </p>
                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>
                    Whiterun is situated between the White River Gorge and the grassy tundra of Whiterun Hold, an open expanse that reaches as far as the eye can see, from the city to the edge of the hold. It is ideal hunting ground for the local hunters and pasture for the farmers. East of the city is the White River, as well as the crossroad that goes in four directions. The north and east road goes up the White River and through the mountain passes until they reach Skyrim's cold fringe. The south path goes up the hills into forested country and eventually the borders of Skyrim. Finally, the west path runs along Whiterun's southern face and a creek where the city's sewers empty in. Along the way are farmsteads and fork that goes either directly into the city, or further into the plains. Whiterun is well-fortified; the road into the city is a fortified hill with three layers of gate and the rest of the city is surrounded by a thick stone wall laden with small watchtowers. Whiterun is neighbored by several settlements, including Black Moor to the west, Laintar Dale to the northeast, Nimalten City to the southeast, and Riverwood to the south.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city is separated into three districts, based on their elevation. The Plains District is Whiterun's center of commerce, riddled with open-aired marketplaces and firmly built cottages that also work as shops for business. At the center of town square are merchant stalls, which all surround the well. The back street behind the homes and toward the wall has small homes and even an entrance to the city barracks. The Winds District is the city's residential area, which divides itself from the lower Plains with another stone wall, at the top of a stone stairway. It is the home of the clan halls of both the Battle-Born and the Gray-Mane families, who have lived in Whiterun for many years. At the center of the district is the sacred tree of Kynareth, the Gildergreen and a small park that circle around it. The historical mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is on the east side of the park, where it stands over the plaza proudly. The highest tier in Whiterun is the Clouds District, where not many people get to often. The only thing here is the Jarl's seat of power, Dragonsreach, which stands mighty above everything across the hold. It looms over the city from atop a long stairway.
