                    Tamriel, also known as Taazokaan in the Dragon Language, is one of the continents on Nirn - the Mortal Plane, the planet upon which Tamriel and the mortal races reside. Tamriel is a great melting pot of cultures and races. It is home to at least a dozen races, with dozens more having died out or changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are nine distinct provinces, each home to one of the more populous races of Tamriel. A proposed tenth province, Orsinium, has never been taken very seriously except by those who want it, namely the Orcs, who wish to have a home province of their own.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel, is a cold and mountainous region also known as the Old Kingdom, Mereth, or the Fatherland, or Keizaal in the dragon tongue. Many past battles have given it a ravaged appearance and many ruins. Though currently inhabited primarily by Nords, the Elves who they replaced had resided there since time immemorial. The sovereign, the High King of Skyrim, is chosen by the Moot, a convention of jarls. A jarl is a regional ruler chosen through heredity and, rarely, through right of arms. The High King typically rules until death, though acts of dishonor, particularly the appearance of cowardice, can lead to the recall and reconsideration of the Moot. Since the Pact of Chieftains was signed in 1E 420, the Moot does not give serious consideration to anyone but the High King's direct heir unless one is not available.

                    Skyrim has nine holds, or regions, each governed by a jarl - Eastmarch, Falkreath Hold, Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, The Pale, The Reach, The Rift, Whiterun Hold, Winterhold. Many of the holds have distinct climates, such as the Rift being an aspen forest, Falkreath Hold being a pine forest, and Eastmarch being tundra. Snowy mountain environments are also found in part of most holds.

                <p>
                    Whiterun Hold is a hold in Skyrim, located roughly in the middle of the province. Roads are numerous and well maintained, and visibility across the plains is excellent. The hold is relatively flat, surrounded the by mountains of the Reach to the west of the Tundra Plateau, the Skyborn Range of Hjaalmarch and the Yorgrim Forest of the Pale to the north, and the Brittleshin Hills of Falkreath to the south. However, Whiterun's southeastern corner is dominated by the gigantic and soaring Throat of the Worldâ€”the highest mountain in all of Tamriel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whiterun is certainly one of the most well-tracked holds, with main roads and excellent access west to the Reach, with a border road north through the town of Rorikstead and up toward Dragon Bridge. The plains have a number of odd barrows and giant camps to investigate, and the center is dominated by Fort Greymoor and the surrounding Greymoor Foothills. The road here allows travel to the north, up through the Skyborn mountains to reach the dreaded Labyrinthian in Hjaalmarch. Further east is Whiterun and the roaring White River and town of Riverwood on the southern border with Falkreath. Another road stretches north from here, into the wilds of the Pale. There's yet another road that skirts the northern foothills of the Throat of the World, following White River Valley into Eastmarch. Although the first of the 7,000 steps that pilgrims climb to reach the summit of Throat of the World begins in Ivarstead (in the Rift), the actual mountain lies within Whiterun's domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giants are often seen traversing the landscape while herding mammoths to grazing areas or back to their camps. Surrounding the eponymous capital, Whiterun, are fertile plains dotted with farms that supply the food for much of Skyrim. The other notable settlements in the hold are Rorikstead and Riverwood.

                    Whiterun is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, serving as the capital of Whiterun Hold and its vast open tundra. It is found in the heart of Skyrim, and because of this, it is the center of trade across the province. It has been described as the <q>Imperial City of Skyrim</q>, and its large palace has been compared to Cyrodilic castles. It has a rich and important history that dates back to the Five Hundred Companions and is the site the mythical forge known as the Skyforge. In the Dragon Language, the city is known as <dfn>Ahrolsedovah</dfn>, which means <dfn>Hill-of-Dragon</dfn>.
                </p>
                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>
                    Whiterun is situated between the White River Gorge and the grassy tundra of Whiterun Hold, an open expanse that reaches as far as the eye can see, from the city to the edge of the hold. It is ideal hunting ground for the local hunters and pasture for the farmers. East of the city is the White River, as well as the crossroad that goes in four directions. The north and east road goes up the White River and through the mountain passes until they reach Skyrim's cold fringe. The south path goes up the hills into forested country and eventually the borders of Skyrim. Finally, the west path runs along Whiterun's southern face and a creek where the city's sewers empty in. Along the way are farmsteads and fork that goes either directly into the city, or further into the plains. Whiterun is well-fortified; the road into the city is a fortified hill with three layers of gate and the rest of the city is surrounded by a thick stone wall laden with small watchtowers. Whiterun is neighbored by several settlements, including Black Moor to the west, Laintar Dale to the northeast, Nimalten City to the southeast, and Riverwood to the south.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city is separated into three districts, based on their elevation. The Plains District is Whiterun's center of commerce, riddled with open-aired marketplaces and firmly built cottages that also work as shops for business. At the center of town square are merchant stalls, which all surround the well. The back street behind the homes and toward the wall has small homes and even an entrance to the city barracks. The Winds District is the city's residential area, which divides itself from the lower Plains with another stone wall, at the top of a stone stairway. It is the home of the clan halls of both the Battle-Born and the Gray-Mane families, who have lived in Whiterun for many years. At the center of the district is the sacred tree of Kynareth, the Gildergreen and a small park that circle around it. The historical mead hall, Jorrvaskr, is on the east side of the park, where it stands over the plaza proudly. The highest tier in Whiterun is the Clouds District, where not many people get to often. The only thing here is the Jarl's seat of power, Dragonsreach, which stands mighty above everything across the hold. It looms over the city from atop a long stairway.

                    Eastmarch is a hold in eastern Skyrim, with its capital in Windhelm. The hold is the home of Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, leader of the Stormcloak rebellion. The Dunmer homeland of Morrowind is to the east, across the Velothi Mountain passes. Since the Red Year, Dunmer have had a much bigger presence in Eastmarch, particularly in the capital, due to its proximity to one of the only passes through the Velothi.
                </p>
                <h2>Topographical Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Eastmarch varies greatly. The central and southern parts of Eastmarch are dominated by sulfurous pools and rocky crags, as well as Bonestrewn Crest. The Velothi Mountains form a spine along the eastern edge of the hold, and a high ridge to the south leads up from the lowland sulfur pools to the Rift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Darkwater River joins the White River in the west, after which the White River merges with River Yorgrim at the Windhelm bridge and flows out into the Sea of Ghosts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sulfur pools are home to giants, deer, sabre cats, and other, smaller creatures, such as rabbits and goats. Further north are snowy sabre cats, ice wolves, and frost trolls along the road to Morrowind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few farms near Windhelm, but otherwise the only plant in the snowy parts of Eastmarch is the humble snowberry bush. In the sulfur region to the south, in the middle of the hold, the endemic plants of dragon's tongue, Jazbay grapes, and creep clusters are to be found. The pine forest and shrublands surrounding the sulfur region are home to thistle, snowberries, and all common varieties of mountain flowers. Mora tapinella and to some extent nightshade can also be found throughout the hold. In the last parts of the White River, stretching from Mixwater Mill to the Sea of Ghosts, nordic barnacle is common.

                <p>
                    Windhelm is a major city in Eastmarch, located near the Dunmeth Pass to Morrowind in northeastern Skyrim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not only the oldest extant city in Skyrim, but it is also the oldest continuously inhabited human settlement in Tamriel. Windhelm was once the capital of the First Empire of the Nords and the old palace of the Ysgramor dynasty. The Palace of the Kings still stands in the center of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lying near the coast on the very northern tip of Eastmarch, Windhelm is an extremely cold city and frequently experiences blizzards. The main gate can only be accessed by crossing a long stone bridge over the White River. The Jarl of Windhelm is Ulfric Stormcloak, who resides in the Palace of the Kings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of its proximity to Morrowind, Windhelm also contains a sizable population of Dark Elves, who sought refuge in Skyrim after the eruption of Red Mountain. The Dark Elves are confined to a cramped slum below the rest of Windhelm called the Gray Quarter, previously known as the Snow Quarter. The Dunmer are not violently persecuted, but the local Nords are suspicious and outwardly xenophobic while Ulfric Stormcloak turns a blind eye to their plight. Argonians also populate Windhelm, but are prohibited from entering the city itself and are forced to live and work on the docks outside the city walls.
                </p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Windhelm was founded by the legendary Ysgramor and the crew of his ship, the Ylgermet, following the Battle of the Moesring in the late Merethic Era. According to Nordic tradition, after the Five Hundred Companions disbanded, the Ylgermet's crew stumbled upon the barrow of Yngol, Ysgramor's son. When Ysgramor looked south and saw where the White River flowed into the Sea of Ghosts, he decreed that a great city should be built there to serve as a monument to the glories of mankind, a place from where he could gaze upon the hill of Yngol's barrow, and a gateway to guard Skyrim's interior against incursion via the river.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Captive elves were forced to build the city in the architectural style of their captors, and it is alleged that as many elves died during Windhelm's construction as were killed by the Ylgermet's crew before they had arrived at the site. The city's great bridge was designed to allow a vigilant watch on the White River for elven attacks, and Ysgramor's palace, the Palace of the Kings, towered over the city to show man's dominion over the very winds that had caused Yngol's death on the voyage from Atmora. An elaborate tomb was built in the catacombs beneath Windhelm to serve as Ysgramor's final resting place upon his death, but was never used because he chose to be buried by the sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ysgramor's descendants would rule the burgeoning territory of the Nords from Windhelm. When Harald assumed the mantle of High King in 1E 143, he relinquished his holdings in Atmora and established Skyrim as an independent kingdom with Windhelm as its capital. During the time of Vrage the Gifted, the city became the capital of not just Skyrim, but the First Empire of the Nords that also encompassed High Rock, Morrowind, and parts of Cyrodiil. When the First Empire of the Nords later collapsed amidst the War of Succession that raged from 1E 369 to 1E 420, the city was sacked.

                    In 2E 431, after the onset of the Interregnum, High King Logrolf was assassinated, precipitating a succession dispute between his daughter, Freydis, and Jarl Svartr of Solitude. While Freydis was accepted as High Queen by the Crown of Verity in Windhelm, a partial Moot convened in Solitude and declared Svartr to be High King. From then on, Skyrim was divided into two kingdoms, with Windhelm serving as the capital of Eastern Skyrim and the seat of Freydis and her line.

                <p>
                    Windhelm was sacked a second time in 2E 572 by the Akaviri army of Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, and then-High Queen Mabjaarn Flame-Hair was slain in battle along with her daughter, Nurnhilde, who briefly succeeded her. The Palace of the Kings was one of the few of the city's original structures that survived these events, however it was badly damaged. The palace court was temporarily displaced as High King Jorunn, who succeeded Nurnhilde, elected to repair the rest of city first, and work on the palace was not completed until 2E 582. At some point during the Second Era, the city also suffered under the disastrous reign of Jarl Elgryr the Unminded, who taxed his citizens to the point of destitution and eventually drove them to revolt.

                <p>
                    In the ninth century of the Second Era, during the formation of the Third Empire of Tamriel, Windhelm served as a base for Imperial troops guarding the Dunmeth Pass into Morrowind prior to that region's incorporation into the Empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Imperial Simulacrum in the late Third Era, the city-state of Windhelm was an active settlement, being ruled by King Asgan. It had a rivalry with Riften and Winterhold. It was neighbored by several settlements, including Amol to the west, Dragon Wood to the south, Laintar Dale to the southwest, and Morrowind to the east, towards Cormar View.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By 4E 201, Windhelm was the center of the Stormcloak Rebellion against the Third Empire. Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, leader of the rebellion, sought to liberate Skyrim from Imperial control to protect the traditional Nord way of life and restore the right to worship Talos, which had been banned Empire-wide by the White-Gold Concordat. In open defiance of the ban, Windhelm's Temple of Talos was kept open throughout the conflict with the Empire. The city had also come to house a substantial population of Dunmer refugees who had fled Morrowind in the aftermath of the Red Year. The elves were relegated to the city's run-down Snow Quarter, later named the Gray Quarter after the Dunmer refugees, and faced constant suspicion from the xenophobic local Nords.

                    The Rift is the most southeasterly of the nine Holds of Skyrim. It is one of the four oldest holds in Skyrim, known collectively as Old Holds. Major settlements include Riften, Ivarstead, and Shor's Stone. Its coat of arms is two crossed daggers. Its capital city, Riften, is home to the Thieves Guild.
                </p>
                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>
                    The Rift is located around the southeastern corner of Skyrim and borders Morrowind to the east and Cyrodiil to the south. The surrounding holds are Eastmarch to the north, Whiterun to the northwest and Falkreath to the west. Much of the Rift is composed of lush, autumn-colored valleys and rivers, surrounded by mountains to the south, east, and northeast. The Rift itself is located atop an immense plateau that clearly separates it from Eastmarch, and the western mountain range south of Throat of the World goes along its border with Falkreath, making it one of the most isolated holds in Skyrim.
                </p>
                <h2>Wildlife</h2>
                <p>
                    The Rift is teeming with wildlife, both docile and hostile. It serves as an excellent hunting ground, and as such encounters with hunters and poachers are common. Bears, Sabre Cats, Frostbite Spiders and wolves make a common practice of hiding in the foliage and ambushing unsuspecting travelers. All of these combined can make traversing the Rift very arduous and time-consuming, even potentially dangerous for low-leveled players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, the dense forest and uneven terrain make landing spots for dragons few and far between, meaning that, even if a dragon were to appear, one may not get a chance to kill it throughout most of the region, as it will fly away shortly after spawning. Trolls are not uncommon here, either.

                    Riften is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, and is the hold capital of the Rift. Built on the shores of Lake Honrich, nestled within the Fall Forest, Riften lies close to Skyrim's borders with Cyrodiil and Morrowind, and enjoys robust trade with the latter via the nearby pass through the Velothi Mountains. Riften is also the home of the Thieves Guild in Skyrim, and has become infamous as a town where the aspiring rogue or thief can rise among the criminal underworld.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The northern, eastern and southern edges of the city, built on the shore of Lake Honrich, are called Dryside. The bulk of the town's residence sits on Dryside, and is split from the western edge known as Plankside, by the Riften canal. Most of the more affluent homes are located on the eastern edge of Dryside, as well as the Temple of Mara, while the southern portion of the city holds the Honorhall Orphanage and Mistveil Keep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The western edge of the city is known as Plankside, built on the waters of Lake Honrich, and serves as the city's business district. The market, shops, meadery, fish hatchery, and the Bee and Barb Inn are all located on Plankside; essentially Dryside is residence while Plankside is business. The buildings on Plankside have been built atop of wooden docks, and the district is old and ramshackle. There are three main docks projecting from Plankside onto the lake, one owned completely by the Black-Briar Meadery and the other two used for commerce and fishery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Riften Canal is the lower level of the city; small residences and an alchemy shop are built into the moisture ridden stone. Dark and traversed only along rickety catwalks, the canal is avoided by the more affluent citizens of Riften, as it is commonplace for muggings and foul play. It also contains the entrance to The Ratway - an underground tunnel system beneath the city of Riften, the city under the city. It is the base of operations for the Thieves Guild and also serves as home for other castoffs such as Lowlifes. Residents urge travelers away from the sprawling tunnel system. If successfully navigated, one might find The Ragged Flagon, the headquarters of the Guild. However, that would mean crossing the dark, tight tunnels and avoiding those too dangerous or outcast not to warrant residency in Riften proper or membership in the Guild.

                    Falkreath Hold is the second southernmost hold in Skyrim, after The Rift, with its capital being Falkreath. It borders Cyrodiil to the south and Hammerfell to the west, with a single road leading to both provinces. Other than its capital, Falkreath, the other notable town in the hold is Helgen, the first settlement in Skyrim to be attacked by a dragon.
                </p>
                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>
                    Falkreath is among the most-traveled Holds in terms of major roads and minor pathways. The lake is an excellent anchoring point, allowing one easy access to surrounding areas via swimming from almost any angle. North of the lake are the sharp and protruding Brittleshin Hillsâ€”snowy peaks dominated by Bleak Falls Barrow that overlook the origin of the White River - and the town of Riverwood just across the border in Whiterun Hold. To the east are the blizzards of the Jerall Mountains, bandit attacks in the high mountain passes, and the windswept caverns of Haemar's Shame. To the south, the Jerall Mountains dominate, their icy crags making many locations difficult to reach and almost impossible to escape from without blade or spell. Still, resolute hunters can still be found in this vast wilderness, determined to live life on their own terms. To the west, the pine forests give way to more rocky scree and sharper crags, where the howls of anger of the Forsworn from the Reach can be heard, and are home to old or forgotten cuts into the earth, including the fabled Twilight Sepulcher.

                    Falkreath is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim, serving as the capital of Falkreath Hold and the boreal forest. The city is widely-known as the "heroes' graveyard," many great battles took place here for centuries, and countless warriors were buried here, leaving behind graves and monuments to them. Because of the nature of the city, the merchants of Falkreath are known to reflect the melancholic themes of death in their business.
                </p>
                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>
                    Falkreath lies in the southern forests of Skyrim, on a strategic crossroad in the middle of its respective hold and the provincial border towards Hammerfell's wilder country, the Dragon's Teeth Mountains. It is built in the forest basin between the Jerall Mountains and the highlands that contain the Shriekwind Bastion, where a small lake forms at the base, suited for a mill in this lumber-town. It is a city that is heavily reliant to the lumber industry, due to the abundance of resources around them. The land outside of the city is largely unpopulated. The Nords of Falkreath are known to master the ability to tame Sabre Cats. Falkreath is neighbored by several settlements, including Neugrad Watch to the northeast, North Keep to the far north, and Hammerfell to the west towards Elinhir.
                </p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <h3>Falkreath's earliest history and the Skyrim Schism</h3>
                <p>
                    Falkreath was founded by the ancient warrior, Bjarfrud Skjoralmor, who drove out the beastly inhabitants and cut down the great forest to build the modern-day settlement. But despite his human heritage, the town's name originates from the elven languages, though its translation is currently unknown. The name, however, bears a strong resemblance with a tribe of Nedes known as the Men-of-'Kreath. Regardless, the warrior's lineage became part of the hold's legacy. But what really cemented the city's longevity was how it represents the province's grand history. Many battles occurred here for countless centuries, and many graves and monuments were built to commemorate the fallen. Because of this, a village grew around it, and it evolved into a hold capital. Falkreath has been an established government since the War of Succession and its destruction paved the way for Olaf One-Eye's ascension to the High Kingship in 1E 420. A statue once stood commemorating the spot where Kjoric the White fell in battle defending Falkreath from the First Empire.
                </p>
                <h3>The Skjoralmor Clan</h3>
                <p>
                    The Skjoralmor Clan has ruled over the Jarldom of Falkreath as far as the mid-Interregnum, under the reign of the western kingdom. When the Imperial Province of Orsinium was sacked in 2E 431, it displaced many Orsimer, who in turn fled to Skyrim and formed a large chiefdom under Yashnag gro-Yazgu. The chiefdom was considered the height of Orcish power in Skyrim and it was stationed in western Falkreath, often harassing the hold capital. High King Svartr was unable to stop the threat it imposed, which ultimately led to the death of the Jarl of Falkreath. His son Hakkvild took his place and challenged Yashnag in a ritual of combat. In the end, Hakkvild had slain the Orcish chief and garnered the title "Yashnag-Slayer". His victory led to the dissolution of the chiefdom and their return to the Wrothgarian Mountains in 2E 467.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Kurog gro-Bagrakh's consolidation of power, he planned to reestablish the Orcish kingdom in Falkreath and create an Orcish city to rival Wayrest. During this period, Kurog's forces were accumulating in the Druadach Mountains, ready to take Falkreath, however, the Nords held them back. Kurog gave this plan up after becoming allies with King Emeric.
                </p>
                <h3>Icereach Coven and the Siege of Falkreath Hold</h3>
                <p>
                    Circa 2E 577, after the Varen's Rebellion Reachfolk were driven out of Cyrodil by Imperial forces. Icreach Coven, as former advisors and teachers of the overthrown Emperor Leovic were among them. They were led by a powerful witch known as Mother Ciannait and during their escape from the Cyrodil they wound up in the area west of Falkreath. They had taken refuge among the graves west of the town and raised numerous dead Nords from the graveyard to defend themselves from Imperial forces. Ultimately Imperials ceased to continue their pursuit once they suffered great losses and left the matters surrounding the Reachfolk incrusion to the local Nords. Nords eventualy managed to cast the faction of Reach Witches out back to their ancient base in the island of Icereach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the years prior to the Alliance War in 2E 582, Falkreath was ruled by Jarl Hjurgol Skjoralmor, who did not act justly in the days leading to the sacking of Falkreath. The Dreadhorn Clan, an alliance of Reachmen and Minotaurs, orchestrated an assault on the city, under the command of Domihaus the Bloody-Horned. The Jarl took to hiding in his longhouse, while his daughter and thane, Eerika Skjoralmor, led the remnants of the resistance. She held the town for some time until the intervention of the Undaunted, who delved through the battlefield and aided the Thane in their efforts to save the city. The group was able to defeat Domihaus at the Jarl's Keep and witness the coronation of Jarl Eerika.
                </p>
                <h3>Falkreath in the Third Empire</h3>
                <p>
                    In the latter years of the Interregnum, Falkreath was once again part of the Colovian Estates, under the command of the Far Falkreath Estate, a merchant clan that maintained ties with the holds of Skyrim. The Colovian Estates were once again split into petty-kings and warlords, while the divided kingdoms of Skyrim had dissolved. King Cuhlecain of Falkreath sought to unify the estates but in order to move forward, he needed to secure his northern border, towards the Reach. His prized general, Hjalti Early-Beard, led his forces at the Battle of Old Hrol'dan, but as the siege proved that breaking the walls was impossible, the next morning he used his Thu'um to obliterate it and win the battle. With this newfound power, King Cuhlecain unified the west and conquered the east, preparing to proclaim himself Emperor. But he was later assassinated and Hjalti, now known as Tiber Septim, was named the Emperor. What followed was the Tiber Wars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Imperial Simulacrum in the late-Third Era, the city-state of Falkreath was an active settlement. It was ruled by King Bjeld, and it had a rivalry with Whiterun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many years later, Dengeir of Stuhn served as the Jarl of Falkreath in the years that preceded the Skyrim Civil War. He was encouraged by many people to step down as the Jarl when he supported the rebellious Stormcloaks, as opposed to the Third Empire. The position of leader of Falkreath was then given to his nephew, Siddgeir, who was known to be arrogant yet loyal to the Empire, although it was his steward Nenya that fulfilled the role as leader much more than him. Legate Skulnar commanded the Imperial Legion throughout Falkreath Hold, and the stronghold of Fort Neugrad was a vital position for Falkreath's allegiance in the civil war.

                            The Reach is one of the nine Holds of Skyrim. Its capital is the ancient Dwemer city of Markarth, where the Empire-aligned Jarl Igmund resides and holds court in Understone Keep.
                        </p>
                       <p>
                           The Reach is infamous for harboring the Forsworn, a clan of Reachmen who are fighting a long war of independence and seek to retake Markarth from the Nords and free the Hold from Imperial authority. The Forsworn are the Reach's most common enemies and dwell in the Reach highlands. With the constant threat of Forsworn attacks looming over Markarth and its surrounding settlements, the Reach is often considered the most dangerous Hold of Skyrim, fit only for seasoned adventurers or hardened mercenaries.
                       </p>
                       <h2>Geography</h2>
                       <p>
                           The Reach covers much of the western border of Skyrim, with High Rock and Hammerfell to the west. These are the Highlands of Skyrim, a rugged environment with few flat clearings, dotted with juniper trees and rich in valuable ores, especially silver. Surrounding Holds include Whiterun to the east, Haafingar past the mountains to the north, Hjaalmarch to the northeast and Falkreath to the southeast.
                       </p>
                       <h2>History</h2>
                       <h3>First Era</h3>
                       <p>
                           During the First Era and the emergence of the Breton race from the Direnni Hegemony, the majority of Bretons established themselves in High Rock. However, a small group of Bretons that were said to have more of the Elven blood than their brethren ventured outward and settled in the western borders of Skyrim. Over the centuries, these Bretons would establish a separate and independent culture from their kin in High Rock and interbred with the local Nords, giving rise to a unique people known as the Reachmen, or the men and women of the Reach. This continued until the Nordic conquests of High Rock and Morrowind during the First Era.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around 1E 1030, the Reach was ruled by ten warring kings. The legendary Reachman Red Eagle rose to prominence, and united the kings in his struggle against the Imperial invading forces of Empress Hestra. Following the collapse of the Alessian Empire, the Reach managed to maintain its independence up until High King Olaf One-Eye expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the Reach.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Second Era</h3>
                        <p>
                            When Tiber Septim was known as General Talos, he went about conquering the whole of Tamriel and consolidating his rule. He also defended the Reach from the Reachmen. One of his famous battles was when he led a small band of Colovian troops and Nord berserkers against the Witchmen of High Rock in the Battle of Old Hrol'dan. Though the Reachmen lost political control of their territory, they did not lose the right to practice their religion and culture. This status quo was accepted by most Reachmen, but not by all.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Fourth Era</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the Fourth Era, when the Mede Empire was in the midst of the Great War with the Aldmeri Dominion, troops from the Reach were called to join the war efforts in Cyrodiil. In the year of 4E 174, hardline Reachmen took this opportunity to rebel against the Empire and slaughter much of the Nord population in the city of Markarth. The uprising gained momentum, pushing the Nords out of the Hold and removing the Reach from Imperial authority for two years. Between 4E 174 and 4E 176, the Reachmen established an independent kingdom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Desperate to reclaim the Reach, Jarl Hrolfdir enlisted the aid of Ulfric Stormcloak and his militia, promising them free worship of Talos in exchange for their assistance. Ulfric accepted, and his troops reconquered Markarth from the Reachmen soon after. The returning Legion, coming back to restore order in Skyrim after the Great War, was allegedly refused entry into Markarth until they granted free Talos worship. The Empire accepted, however, agents of the Aldmeri Dominion discovered the Empire was violating the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, and demanded the arrest of Ulfric and his militia. This is known as the <q>Markarth Incident</q> and is one of the direct causes of the Skyrim Civil War.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Reachmen took on the name of the Forsworn after their defeat in Markarth, and those not imprisoned fled to the highlands to continue their insurrection against the Empire's control over the Reach.

                            Markarth (translated as <q>Above the Karth</q> in the Reach language) is one of the nine major cities in the province of Skyrim and the capital of the Reach. Known as the <q>City of Stone</q>, it is a former Dwarven city built through a large stone crag, intricately designed around the cliffs and waterfalls from the environment. Since the region is poor farmland, Markarth is mainly a mining-town that has a vast influx of silver veins in the mountain. The city is the focal point of power throughout the region. It is often disputed over between the Reachmen and the Nords. Markarth was founded on the abandoned remains of the radiant city, Nchuand-Zel.

                        <p>
                            Markarth is one of the larger cities in Skyrim, nestled in the river valley of the Druadach Mountains. It is unique in that the city's layout is intricately built into the mountain of Karthmad. The city is split by a large running river and comprises two parts: Riverside, where the native Reachmen and the working district are found; and the Dryside, housing all the houses of Nord nobles and Silver-Blood ownership. The Jarl's palace, Understone Keep, is located at the top of the city and contains the Hall of the Dead, the Dwemer Museum, and the Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site where the internal part of the old Dwemer city remains in ruins. Most of the city's residents tend to be quite unfriendly to outsiders.

                            The precipices between the keep and the Riverside contain the city's smithy and other important places, like the local crypt and the Markarth Ruins. There is an ornate temple on the highest peak of the crag that has been used for different deities. It has been known as Shrine of the Hunt Father and used by the cult of Hircine during the Reach's independence in the Second Era, whereas, under the Third Empire, it contained the local chapter of the House of Dibella. Underneath the crag are the slums of Markarth, known as the Warrens, which is a collapsed hallway with campfires bearing minimal light. During Reachfolk rule of the city Warens were not in ruin and known as the Underhall and functioned as hub of commerce and craftsmanship. Markarth Side is neighbored by several settlements, including Dragon Bridge to the north and Snowhawk to the south.

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <h3>Origins</h3>
                        <p>
                            Markarth was the former city of Nchuand-Zel, belonging to the ancient Dwemer who resided in Morrowind, Skyrim, Hammerfell and High Rock during the Merethic Era and First Era. Following the disappearance of the Dwemer from the face of Nirn after they attempted to control the power of the Numidium, Markarth was abandoned until the natives of the Reach known as Reachmen, moved into the city. The rise of High King Olaf One-Eye, who expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the Reach, saw that the city be turned over to Nord control.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Establishment</h3>
                        <p>
                            In gratitude for the service of the Tongues in Tamriel's long and complex history, Emperor Tiber Septim established the Imperial College of the Voice in Markarth, which was dedicated to returning the Way of the Voice to the ancient and honorable art of war. So it may be that the mighty deeds of the Nord heroes of old will soon be equalled or surpassed on the battlefields of the present day. Unlike the other Dwemer cities and strongholds located in Morrowind, Hammerfell, High Rock and Skyrim, the city of Markarth was not constructed out of metal, but instead was primarily built out of stone. According to Amanda Alleia, a mercenary in Markarth, Dwemer miners had cut out the city from the mountains, which probably means that the external part of the city that's outside of the mountains was built by the Dwemer themselves.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Forsworn Uprising</h3>
                        <p>
                            In 4E 174, Markarth, and the Reach as a whole, were subjected to what is known today as the <q>Forsworn Uprising</q>. While the Empire was beset by the Third Aldmeri Dominion in the Great War, the native people of the Reach, called the Reachmen, took this opportunity to seize control of the city. This was only possible as the Imperial Legionnaires stationed in Markarth were recalled to fight, leaving the city highly vulnerable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jarl Hrolfdir could not quell the uprising and was driven out of the city. The rebellion was successful and the Reachmen ruled over Markarth and The Reach as an independent kingdom from Skyrim from 4E 174-176. According to one Imperial source, the kingdom was relatively peaceful during this time. The Reachmen allegedly ruled their lands fairly, and even made overtures to be recognized by the Empire as a legitimate kingdom. Others claimed that it was a chaotic uprising and that Markarth's nobles grew desperate when the Reachmen refused their offers of peace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Desperate to reclaim the Reach, Jarl Hrolfdir enlisted the aid of Ulfric Stormcloak and his militia, promising them free worship of Talos in exchange for their assistance. Ulfric accepted, and his troops reconquered Markarth from the Reachmen soon after. The returning Legion, coming back to restore order in Skyrim after the Great War, was allegedly refused entry into Markarth until they granted free Talos worship. The Empire accepted, however, agents of the Aldmeri Dominion discovered the Empire was violating the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, and demanded the arrest of Ulfric and his militia. This is known as the <q>Markarth Incident</q> and is one of the direct causes of the Skyrim Civil War.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Reachmen took on the name of the Forsworn after their defeat in Markarth, and those not imprisoned fled to the highlands to continue their insurrection against the Empire's control over the Reach.

                           Haafingar is a mountainous, coastal hold in northwestern Skyrim and the smallest of all nine holds. Its capital is the city of Solitude, and the two are sometimes treated as the same. However, Haafingar is far more than just Solitude.

                       <h2>Geography</h2>
                       <p>
                           The hold is separated from Hjaalmarch by the Karth River and The Reach by mountains. Dragon Bridge is the only access to the hold by road, crossing the Karth River. Much of the hold is rocky and mountainous with soaring snowy mountains surrounding the north and west of Solitude, though the lower lying areas including Dragon Bridge are mostly comprised of forests and hills.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           The Karth River allows for a great deal of commerce in Solitude and the town of Dragon Bridge in the Karth River Forest (mostly in timber and fish), and the long Giant's Coastline with the Sea of Ghosts is littered with frozen shipwrecks and treasures. Mount Kilkreath and its associated mountains take a large portion of the hold and it is filled with caves and ruins where bandits and creatures make their homes.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                           Over 80 percent of the Hold's population lies within Solitude's walls, but this is testament to the city's political importance, formidable defenses and diverse population.

                       <p>
                           Given Solitude's obvious importance as a major city, many forts and castles were established around the hold to deter and defend from attackers. Most have fallen into disrepair or have been completely demolished.

                           In 3E 127, after the death of Uriel Septim III, his mother, Potema, turned Haafingar for the next 10 years to the land of death. Stories of the ancient Wolf Queen being waited on by rotting skeletal chambermaids and holding war plans with vampiric generals terrified her subjects.

                           In 3E 145, the Jarl of Solitude, Pelagius Septim III was declared Emperor. Unlike most Emperors he ruled mainly from Solitude and not the Imperial City. Almost from the start of the reign of Pelagius III, the eccentricities of his behavior were noted. He embarrassed dignitaries, offended his vassal kings, and, on one occasion, marked the end of a grand ball by attempting to hang himself. His madness is speculated to have been caused by Potema the Wolf Queen, whose own insanity was said to have been infused in Castle Solitude, infecting the next king to rule there.

                           In the Fourth Era, following the Great War, the Thalmor established an embassy in these mountains from which to root out the worship of Talos in Skyrim. At the time, around 80% of the hold's population was in Solitude.

                            Solitude is the capital city of both Haafingar Hold, and all of Skyrim. Currently ruled by Jarl Elisif the Fair, widow of the late High King Torygg, it is the headquarters of the Imperial Legion stationed in Skyrim. General Tullius commands the Imperial army from the stone-walled Castle Dour, while Solitude's Jarl, Elisif, resides in the Blue Palace. The Thalmor have an embassy hidden in the nearby mountains.

                        <h2>Geography</h2>
                        <p>
                            Solitude is both a reinforced and breathtaking stronghold. Set upon a great peninsula, known as the Great Arch, that towers above the mouth of the Karth River, the city is surrounded by the soaring peaks of the nearby Kilkreath Mountain. Because of the uneven terrain outside of the city walls, there is very little room for private land for farms. There was a lumber mill built on the Karth River and even small farms on the highlands, between the main road and the docks. Solitude is neighbored by several settlements, including Dragon Bridge to the south and High Rock to the far west.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The road towards Solitude's entrance is heavily-defended by the gates, the Squall Gate and the Storm Gate, as well as several towers. The main road runs underneath the arch and goes around the region's east coast until it reaches the hinterlands and the provincial border.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Solitude is also a major shipping port and important Imperial supply line. Most of the shipping in Solitude is run by the Imperial-financed East Empire Company. The docks are located underneath the Great Arch. There is a vast cavern underneath the mountain that is currently used by the East Empire Company as one of their largest warehouses.

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <h3>Early History</h3>
                        <p>
                            Solitude's founding dates back centuries ago before it extended onto the great arch. It was an encampment on the Karth River situated at the base of the landmark, where it was used as a windbreaker. It was an ideal base for the ancient Nords, who built fur and wooden shelters on the river's shores. The founders of Solitude were said to be deeply devoted to the Divines, and this sentiment continues to live in modern-times as the local temple became the biggest place of worship in Skyrim. The town started as a simple castle keep, which is now known as Castle Dour, but it later gained more of its footing as a well-defended settlement during the coronation of High King Erling, who ordered the construction of Solitude's outer walls around the keep. He later ordered the construction of a towering bridge that separates the Well District from the east-side. The city's unique style of architecture was chosen by the High King himself, but the true mastermind that created it is unknown, though the person, Thryrahilde is said to have championed the motif before the walls were built. Sometime before the province of Skyrim was formally founded by High King Harald in 1E 143, the Emperor's Tower, the original home of Haafingar's kings and the centerpiece of the keep was replaced by the Blue Palace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The earliest known texts that describe Solitude as a well-established kingdom date to the early First Era, when the province held ties with the First Empire, concurrent to the formation of the Bards College. The Kingdom of Solitude was one of the greatest oppositions against Olaf One-Eye, who rose to supremacy in the wake of the War of Succession. Olaf's wrath over the city was swiftly-executed and animosity between the king and the city created one of Solitude's longest-living traditions, the Burning of King Olaf. It is held annually in the courtyard at the Bards College. Solitude has since become one of the most significant trading ports, collaborating with other cities of worth such as Senchal, Wayrest, and West Anvil. Following the First Akaviri Invasion in 1E 2704, Emperor Reman I shifted focus to the Reach, splitting into its east and western-half. He utilized several forays from both Solitude and Evermore to quell the spirits of the local Reachmen, but these attempts were unsuccessful since taming the landscape was much harder for these soldiers.
                        </p>
                        <h3>First Era</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the late-First Era, the Kingdom of Solitude was ruled by the tyrannical High Queen, "Head Rolling" Roleke, who killed twenty rebels within less than five minutes. Her reign brought contempt amongst her people, who took arms and began their siege over the Blue Palace. From another region, the young jarl of a forgotten hold, Irthvyd joined the uprising and approached the city gates. However, he was stopped by a visage of Kyne, who told him that the High Queen was killed by her progeny, who in turn died in battle. Solitude was in need of order and the Goddess of Storms chose Irthvyd to take assume the mantle of High King. He was thus named the new High King of Solitude and established peace throughout Haafingar Hold, however, he died without an heir, and so his senior advisor, Temylda ascended the throne after a fight with several other jarls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Forty years later, Temylda's reign ended and a new leader was chosen, out of bloodshot and violence. The warrior, Alldimar, known for his many skirmishes with the Reachmen, won the title of High Kingship from the child successor, using his years of knowledge in arcane magic and his great sense of warfare. Peace swept through the kingdom but random people throughout his tenure died of bizarre accidents, and his cold-eyed advisor, Freiretta was the subject of countless rumors and conspiracies. By the time Alldimar had passed, the secrets were revealed. The skulls of those "accident" victims were stored in a hidden compartment of the High King's quarters. Whatever purpose it may have been is unknown, but he has since been remembered as the "Ghostmaker". Servants at the Blue Palace say they hear voices and see shapes out of the corner of their eye to this day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2E 431, the assassination of High King Logrolf brought about a time of change in the province of Skyrim. Naturally, the throne would have been passed to the High King's next of kin, ideally, Jarl Freydis of Windhelm. However, tension had arisen between the east and west when Jarl Svartr of Solitude had challenged her claim to leadership and thus called for a moot. The moot had chosen Svartr as their High King, and what followed was a decisive schism that created the West and East Kingdoms of Skyrim, with the west under the rule of High King Svartr of Solitude. His domain became the capital of the western kingdom, which remained active for several years. One of his descendants, Svargrim the Wolf had defended the hold throughout his reign, such as when he beheaded the Sea Giant captain, Kruntharth and later his escapades in the Great Troll Rut of 2E 565, a time of unspeakable horror. Since that day, Trolls had avoided Solitude for years.

                        <h3>The Calamity of Solitude</h3>
                        <p>
                            After a failed assassination attempt on the Eastern High King, Jorunn, the Icereach Coven had traveled to the heart of Western Skyrim and began to sow the seeds for their next endeavor. Agents of the Skald-King, namely Lyris Titanborn traveled to the capital, Solitude and began their investigation. Their sources uncovered strange houseware imported from Sentinel and pamphlets for a mining operation in the Druadach Mountains handed out by Reachmen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After one of these agents was killed in action, Lyris enlisted the help of a traveler and met with the High Queen of Western Skyrim, Gerhyld. Unlike the High King, who has a deep hatred for the Skald-King and thus suspects the agents, she was more willing to hear them out. She offered them more time to proved irrefutable proof. They scoured the city for more information and later traveled to Mount Kilkreath, where they witnessed a massacre at the Kilkreath Temple and disrupted the first of several harrowstorms. With all of the evidence in hand, the two return to Solitude, only to find the High Queen had been assassinated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite the incident, High King Svargrim chose not to make the proper initiative to deal with the threat, so his daughter, Princess Svana and the eastern agents took it upon themselves to warn the neighboring holds, Hjaalmarch and Karthald about the impending danger. While they managed to recruit Jarl Reddharn of Morthal, they found the mountain town of Karthwatch devastated at the hands of another harrowstorm created by the coven. Refugees were escorted back to Solitude, where they remained safe within the confines of the city. Through Jarl Reddharn and Magister Fridelja of Karthwatch's testimonies, Svargrim begrudgingly moved forward by rounding up the harrowed to lock them away in the Tower of the Wolf in Castle Dour. He later sent soldiers to guard Solitude's outer defense and began to stockpile Castle Dour for the impending siege. One of their allies, the vampire, Fennorian of House Ravenwatch began to develop an elixir that would bypass the harrowstorm and disrupt its effects. It was after everyone in his hold turned against him, Svargrim revealed his allegiance with the Gray Host and their lord, Rada al-Saran.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After his reveal, the Gray Host took control over Castle Dour, which was sealed from the rest of the city. Svargrim disappeared from the palace and delved into the underground realm of Blackreach. Svana and her companions followed suit and fought their way through Greymoor Keep, an enormous vampire castle found directly underneath Solitude. In the keep, the High King underwent a gruesome ritual that turned him into a vampire lord and provided him control over the harrowstorm that would soon engulfed Solitude. From the Temple of the Divines, the harrowed poured out of Castle Dour and attempted to break through to the city proper. Fennorian and Lyris Titanborn fought waves upon waves of enemies at the base floor of the keep while Svana and the traveler ascended the Tower of the Wolf to confront High King Svargrim. After a great battle, the High King was slain and the Gray Host had been defeated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mere moments after, the High King of Eastern Skyrim, Jorunn, and his son, Prince Irnskar had marched into Solitude, offering their assistance to the cause, despite their history with the west. Everyone gathered for a traditional wake, dedicated to the people that lost their lives throughout the event. Even with the city saved from crisis, the war with the Gray Host continued. Fennorian developed his elixir, and the Jarls of Skyrim devised a plan to spread the cure across their holds.

                        <h3>The Wolf-Queen</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the early Third Era, the elderly King Mantiarco reigned over Solitude in the years of the Third Empire, under the rule of Emperor Uriel Septim II. However, the relations between the Nordic kingdom and the Empire had slowly waned, prompting the union between King Mantiarco and the then fourteen-year-old, Potema Septim. At first, she was only a pawn of a political marriage, but the King's love for her had led to her rise in power to totality. After several miscarriages, in 3E 97, Potema gave birth to Uriel Mantiarco and he was quickly named the heir of Solitude. In 3E 99, the Emperor and later in the spring, King Mantiarco had passed away, leaving the kingdom in a joint-rule between King Uriel and Queen Potema. In this time, the Queen had established relationships across the northern tier of the empire, sowing the seeds of contempt against the Empire.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her relationship with the Empire came to a climax in the coronation of Empress Kintyra II when she degraded the newly-named ruler and her mother, Magna by questioning their legitimacy to the Ruby Throne. King Uriel III and Queen Potema were banished from the inner court, returning to Solitude to form a large-scale rebellion against the Third Empire. These events gave way to the War of the Red Diamond, which escalated to the death of the Empress in 3E 114 and the ascension of Emperor Uriel Septim III. But the conflict slowly ended in the favor of Kings Cephorus I and Magnus when the former defeated the Emperor and brought him to his death in Gilane.

                        <p>
                            By 3E 137, the kingdom became a land of death and the elderly Queen Potema was kept in the Blue Palace, as Emperor Cephorus I relentlessly sacked the city of Solitude. With no real army at her disposal, Potema used daedra, her necromancers and the undead to face against her brother. She died sometime during the siege but her legacy continued through underground factions like the HÃ¶rme. But some theologians hypothesized that Potema became a spiritual-daedra that continually haunts the Blue Palace and turns its monarchs insane. This is one of the theories that is attributed to Pelagius III's insanity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following Potema's defeat, Pelagius III was named the King of Solitude, placed there by Emperor Cephorus. In his time spent in Solitude, Pelagius began to exhibit signs of insanity which earned the moniker, "Pelagius the Mad." There were many stories of his peculiar eccentricities, such as his constant shift in weight but expressive personality. These were far and few between, but only became worse when his father, Magnus I became the Emperor of Tamriel in 3E 140 and more attention went towards the Kingdom of Solitude, knowing that Pelagius III was the heir-apparent. Legends had spread throughout the Empire as Pelagius III's exploits became more well-known, such as countless declarations of war to the Kingdom of Silvenar or the many cases of stripping during public speeches. By the decree of his father, Pelagius III married Duchess Katariah of Vvardenfell, whose family, the Ra'athim Clan was acquainted with Potema during the war. Despite the political motives, it was also a personal choice by the Emperor, who recognized Katariah as a shrewd diplomat. When the Emperor passed away in 3E 145, Pelagius III and Katariah moved to the Imperial City and his sister, Jolethe became the Queen of Solitude.

                        <h3>Third &amp; Fourth Era</h3>
                        <p>
                            During the Imperial Simulacrum in the late-Third Era, the city-state of Solitude was an active settlement. It was ruled by Queen Hania and it had a rivalry with Snowhawk. At some point in time, the Kingdom of Solitude waged war with the distant Kingdom of Farrun. They left one of the soldiers, the Bosmeri mercenary, Menegur to man the walls of Cascabel Hall against the enemy. After three months of maintaining Cascabel, Solitude and Farrun made a truce and gave the castle to Menegur for his valiant effort. By the waning years of the Third Era in 3E 432, it was ruled by King Thian, in the time where Solitude was one of the most influential counties in the province. Under Thian's leadership, it expanded much further with the union with Queen Macalla, engulfing another major port city, the town of Dawnstar. But it also went further north with the annexation of the Fiefdom of Roscrea, former territory conquered by Emperor Uriel Septim V in 3E 271. Solitude soon sponsored several expeditions that attempted to explore the northern waters beyond Skyrim's coast and Roscrea.

                            Another city that prospered in that time was the former capital, Winterhold, but its legacy was later destroyed by the Great Collapse in 4E 122. By the next couple centuries, Solitude was ruled by High King Istlod, who led for nearly twenty-five years until he passed away. The moot later chose his son, Torygg to be his successor. In 4E 201, the High King was approached by the Jarl of Windhelm, Ulfric Stormcloak, who challenged him in a duel for leadership. What many did not realize was that he used the power of his Thu'um to obliterate the High King and kill him. With the help of his supporters, he escaped Solitude and prepared for war.
